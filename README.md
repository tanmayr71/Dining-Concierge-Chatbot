- **Scalable and Serverless:** Built with AWS Lambda, Lex, API Gateway, and DynamoDB, ensuring a scalable and efficient architecture.
- **Secure and Reliable:** Uses AWS SES for secure email communications and ElasticSearch for efficient data retrieval.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Lex:** Natural language understanding and conversational interface.
- **AWS Lambda:** Serverless compute for handling backend logic.
- **API Gateway:** Secure API management and routing.
- **DynamoDB:** NoSQL database for fast and scalable data storage.
- **ElasticSearch:** Search and analytics engine for efficient data querying.
- **AWS SES:** Email service for sending recommendations.
- **Python:** Core programming language for Lambda functions.

## Project Structure

Here is an overview of the key files in the project and their roles:

- **LF0.py**: Contains specific logic and functions related to handling particular intents or actions by the chatbot.
- **LF2.py**: Similar to LF0.py, this file includes additional logic for managing different functionalities or interactions in the chatbot.
- **utils.py**: Utility functions that support various operations across the project, such as data formatting and common helper methods.
- **validations.py**: Functions for validating user input and other data to ensure proper processing and avoid errors.
- **lambda_function.py**: The main entry point for AWS Lambda, orchestrating the chatbot's responses, interacting with other AWS services, and managing session data.
- **actions.py**: Core actions or behaviors the chatbot performs, such as fetching restaurant data, processing user requests, and generating responses.
